# Website-Templates
The principal reason for this site is to help programmers and IT/Computer Science students by giving a free and complete source code that can be used in their own application, school projects, thesis requirements, and the likes. I began creating Bermz Intelligent Software Solutions since 2014 in the plan to give a business item to everybody in the web. Be that as it may, I adjust my perspective. Rather than tolerating more customers from the web I chose to share my source code in view of the interest of my administration locally. And now, I have created Educatque, to bring much availability of sharing my source codes and projects to the community.
